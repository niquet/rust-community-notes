## Motivation for Using Rust

| Motivation                             | Explanation                                                                                                                                                                                                         |

| Empowerment                            | Rust is all about empowering developers to program with confidence across a wide range of domains.                                                                                                                  |
| User-Friendly Tools                    | It offers a polished set of tools that simplify the complexities of memory management, data representation, and concurrency.                                                                                        |
| Safety and Security                    | Rust helps you avoid the common risks of crashes and security vulnerabilities without requiring you to master the intricacies of a complex toolchain.                                                               |
| Towards Reliability                    | The design of Rust naturally steers you towards writing reliable code that is efficient in both speed and memory usage.                                                                                             |
| Versatility Beyond Systems Programming | While Rust is excellent for low-level systems programming, it is also expressive and user-friendly enough for creating CLI applications, web servers, and much more.                                                |
| Transferable Skills                    | Learning Rust equips you with skills that can be applied across different domains; for example, you can start by building a web application and later use those same skills to develop software for a Raspberry Pi. |
