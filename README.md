1. **Embrace Ownership:** Rust's ownership model is your friend. It helps you avoid those pesky memory bugs!

3. **Read the Compiler Messages:** Seriously, they‚Äôre like your personal mentor‚Äîlisten to them!
4. **Practice with Small Projects:** Build tiny projects to solidify your understanding before diving into larger ones.
